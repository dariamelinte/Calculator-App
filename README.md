# Calculator-App

The app was created as a project for a better understanding of the iOS Development and Swift 5.

With this project I was able to use concepts learned in order to style screens, such as:
- AutoLayout, which helped me to group different elements.
- Alignment and Pinning
- Stack Views
- Responsive Screens

I had a better understanding of the importance of grouping or complex layouting. Besides the visual part, I took a step forward and created the functionality of the calculator. Even if the app seems basic, creating the logic behind everything helped me understand:

- How to link different elements to the same IBAction
- Swift specific syntax in writing functions
- How to work with strings and different types on Swift
